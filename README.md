## Cover letter to add

Hello, 

I am a highly motivated and goal-oriented UI/UX Designer with a solid background. As a UI/UX Design professional, I have demonstrated the ability to conduct creative analysis and design best-fit solutions for multi-faceted campaigns such as interactive media, web design, and app design. I've worked with clients of all backgrounds and industries to create and implement thoughtful and impactful branding tools to help their businesses grow.

I am currently working as an intern UI/UX Designer in a world of wealth fintech start-up company, where I am part of the design team and am in charge of designing and launching the first iteration of the product. I begin by designing with the needs of the users and the problem at hand in mind, and then I do my best to spice up my creation with perfectly blended colours and structures. I am also knowledgeable and skilled in various UI/UX software such as Figma, Adobe XD, and Adobe Illustrator. & working with various product methodologies such as Agile and Waterfall. I also have a strong background in development, which allows me to communicate effectively with developers. I am skilled at team leadership and product development. 

My learning curve is always increasing, as I am currently studying 'Human Computer Interaction'. I want to be a valuable asset to the company. I always enjoy working in a motivated and upbeat environment. I eagerly await your response.

 Thank You!
